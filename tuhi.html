<p style="color:whitesmoke">Earliest surviving edits and other data
In December 2010, Wikipedia backups containing all edits from Wikipedia's inception to 17 August 2001 were discovered by Tim Starling, although many of these edits are not present in the current database. The earliest edit found was made to HomePage on 15 January 2001, reading "This is the new WikiPedia!" However, in 2010 Jimmy Wales stated that he made Wikipedia's first edit, a test edit to the homepage with the text "Hello, World!", after installing UseModWiki. This edit is not present in the older archives, and in 2011 Starling speculated that it may have been made on a test wiki that was later deleted. The HomePage edit was re-imported in 2019, and, upon being informed of this, Wales clarified that the "Hello, World!" edit was deleted manually from a hard drive; it remains unclear as to whether it had been made to a test wiki or to the modern Wikipedia.</p>
